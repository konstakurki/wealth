<p>Whenever there’s a number measuring our doing, there’s also a good chance to get obsessed. Bodybuilders seek for greater and greater muscular mass, which has <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQtHIL_dUlM'>lead</a> to alien body shapes that people don’t find aesthetic anymore.</p>

<p>In society there’s one number above all: money. We use it to measure material stuff, work, criminal punishments and debt (technically, modern money like &euro; or $ <em>is</em> debt). Since society runs on budget calculations, it’s difficult to not to stare money figures. Our system is blind to anything else, which makes us too obsessed about money. There’s two sides to this obsession: first, we want to put a figure on everything. Second, we want more money, and more money.</p>

<p>It’s obvious that our faith in money as a universal measure of value is false. Money is excellent at measuring simple resources like food and electricity, yet it ignores anything truly humane, like friendships, and environmental damage, for example.</p>

<!--<p>It is our obsession to money that enables the wealth to collapse on one individual.</p>-->

<p>Can money be avoided? Markets are needed for the society to be able to organize, and in a market economy people tend to measure value with respect to some generally valued resource. If there was no money, some resource—like salt or gold—would soon start to act as money. Free society cannot escape money.</p>

<h2 id='3-1-why-do-we-want-money'>3.1 Why do we want money?</h2>

<p>Everybody knows that everybody wants money. There are good reasons for that: money can buy you a better standard of living, appreciation and power.</p>

<h3>Standard of living</h3>

<p>We can’t stay alive without food, and for getting it we need money. This is why some people beg on the streets. It’s annoying, yet it stems from basic survival instincts.</p>

<p>In Finland something like &euro;300 each month buys you enough food for living, yet it’s not enough for paying a rent (assuming you first feed yourself). Double that, and you can rent a cheap apartment. Double again, and you can move to central Helsinki (our capital city) and use taxi (or Uber)—or alternatively, you can start skydiving (200 jumps a year, which is quite a lot, costs on average &euro;500 per month, including gear expenses).</p>

<p>Thanks to cheap electronics and Internet connections, nowadays the most interesting things cost less than food. If you can afford to stay alive, you can also afford to keep in touch with all your friends, study any subject you wish, write software, consume music, TV series and movies, compose music, practise photography, <em>etc.</em></p>

<p>Third doubling—and now we are talking about &euro;2,400 per month, which is about the same as an elementary school teacher’s salary after tax—and you can live in Helsinki, skydive, use taxi, and fly a few times a year. Fourth doubling lets you pick up a couple more exotic hobbies, go around the globe, and so on. One or two more doublings and you can visit space once a year.</p>

<p>The more you have, the less your standard of living changes by doubling your income. &euro;1,000 per month is enough for good (or even excellent, according to my experience) life, and something like &euro;10,000 per month is enough for the maximum achievable standard of living on Earth in 2017.</p>

<p>It’s reasonable to want the first doubling, since living on the streets makes things difficult. Yet as the standard goes up, the reasons to upgrade go down, and at some point the cost of upgrade in terms of time and other sacrifices is not worth it. Due to our obsession to numbers, we often do calculation errors and sacrifice too much for too little.</p>

<h3>Appreciation</h3>

<p>Since we believe in money’s capability to measure value so firmly, we can (or at least try to) increase our value in other people’s eyes by looking wealthy. This is subconscious and embarrassing, but real.</p>

<p>Most of us aim to co-operate with others. We like those who are helpful to us and dislike those who aren’t. We feel good, if we are liked, and bad, if we are disliked. This is all normal and essential for social co-operation to work. Like and dislike are evolved tools for handling complex social relationships.</p>

<p>Money mixes this thing up. Someone who earns good money, appears as helpful: if someone wants to pay you well, surely you must be a really great guy. So you think that if you can make more money, you become more helpful and you will be liked more. If you have a lot of money, some people do at least superficially like you, and some will just pretend liking you, in hope for benefiting from your money. This gives you positive feedback and makes you believe even more firmly that money makes you a good guy.</p>

<p>This is the main reason we buy status symbols. They aim to signal others that we are helpful. Clothes, cars, houses, luxury trips, and the more expensive, the stronger the signal.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>

<p>You may want to do something you can’t do alone. If there are volunteers willing to take your orders, that’s good. If not, you can exploit other people’s want of money by making them an offer: you do that and I’ll give you this much money. It’s called hiring.</p>

<p>The fact that people want money makes money an instrument of power. People want money badly, so money is a terrific instrument of power. Some people use the instrument well and some less well.</p>

<p>Doubling the income does not increase the standard of living after &euro;10,000 per month, yet the same doesn’t hold for power: doubling the money always doubles the power. This simple fact means that when we talk about very rich individuals, it’s always about power.</p>

<p>If you want to make people do something good, you need money. If you have some amount of money, you may think, “if I had twice as much, I could make twice as many people do good,” and you would be right. It’s easy to slip into making more and more and more money, postponing the good thing indefinitely. In mathematics this kind of decision-making is called greedy.</p>

<p>A greedy algorithm always makes optimal decisions in short term, yet may be a complete failure in the long term. A central pillar of the theory of capitalism relies on the optimal short term decicions yt it fails to take account the greediness. etc</p>

<p>There is also a darker, and probably more relevant, side to this issue. A few percent of us do not aim for co-operation, but for control over others. These people want power purely for the sake of power and don’t have a problem with lying and manipulation. Words like narcissist, psychopath, sociopath and anti-social personality have born out of the need to describe these people. I simply call them cheats.</p>

<p>Cheats are generally unempathic and have no problem in making ruthless decisions in order to make profit. This gives them a competitive advantage: they beat consistently traders that prioritize safety, environment protection, and other “soft” values.</p>

<p>The end result is that a large portion of the wealthy use their money power just to get more money to get more power. In this level of the game money and power are almost equivalent things.</p>

<p>Now, as wealth concentrates, so does power. That most people loose their freedom as they drop into poverty is not only a consequence of the concentration of wealth, but also one of its goals, as poor person is always easier to control than someone who’s doing good.</p>
