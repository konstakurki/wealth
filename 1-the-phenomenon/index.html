<h1>1. The Phenomenon</h1>

<p><em>Updated on August 2, 2017</em></p>

<p><em>I’m willing to hear about any flaws in the logic or facts in the text.</em></p>

<p>Every form of life needs resources to survive. Human life is somewhat complex, and for our lives to be humane, we need many kinds of resources. In a modern society we get these resources almost solely by buying them from traders.</p>

<p>Nowadays there are many kinds of trading. In a local grocery store money is traded with food. Bankers trade debt and in the stock market people trade small pieces of companies.</p>

<p>Traders aim to profit, that is, sell their assets with greater price that they paid for getting them. While for the society the point of trading is intermediating assets from those who have them to those who need them, for traders themselves the point is profits.</p>

<p>Free market economy works well if there are not too much variation in the economic situations of citizens, as the laws of supply and demand and competition—or the invisible hand that Adam Smith wrote about—pushes traders to deliver better products and services for lower price tags.</p>

<p>If economic inequality gets too high, the power of the wealthiest parties exceeds the market forces. A wealthy company may, for example, buy every competitor that emerges, and therefore maintain a monopoly position, which in turn lets it charge arbitrarily high prices and avoid investing in manufacturing good and developing better products.</p>

<h2>1.1 The logic of wealth accumulation</h2>

<p><em>Money goes to money.</em> It’s almost as simple as that. There are nuances to the question, which I’ll go through now. In the following I use the word “trader” to mean any entrepreneur, investor, businessman, <em>etc.</em></p>

<p>In most cases trading is, or can be thought of as, owning certain kinds of wealth, for example a restaurant, a taxi car or stocks of a bank corporation, that the trader expects to return him or her revenue. The wealthier the trader is, the greater revenues he or she is able to gain. If the revenue exceeds the spending of the trader, he or she gets richer.</p>

<p>Of course, not every stack of wealth grows with an equal relative rate, and some stacks shrink. A wealthy trader may get less wealthy, which usually means that another trader gets wealthier. The specific individuals who hold the highest stacks may change, yet the size of the highest stacks tends to increase.</p>

<p>We can see this easily in real data. <cite>Forbes 400</cite> is a list of the 400 wealthiest US citizens. In 1991 the combined wealth of the list was <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/07/business/71-billionaires-on-forbes-list.html'>$288 billion</a>. In 2015 it had become <a href='http://time.com/4053748/forbes-400-richest-americans/'>$2,340 billion</a>. This means more than 8-fold increase in 24 years, or 9.1% per year on average. (The numbers have not been adjusted for inflation, which is something like 2% per year.)</p>

<p>Only a minority of us have enough the right kind of wealth for making a living. In other words, only some of us are successful traders. Most have to make their living by other ways.</p>

<p>Usually wealth returns revenues only, if there are people making it happen. A restaurant needs chefs and waiters, for example. Workers must be hired to run the process. This is how the majority of people make their living in a prototypical capitalistic society. As wealth earns returns, it also feeds a bunch of workers, and so the benefits trickle down to the general public.</p>

<p>To measure economic inequality, we must compare the economic situation of an average person to the economic situation of a typical very rich individual. It’s not very meaningful to measure an average person’s economic situation by wealth owned by him or her, since there are lots of people who own nothing, but still are doing well. These people live vuokralla, use public transportation, <em>etc.</em></p>

<p>An average person’s economic situation is better measured by the median wage. In 1991 <a href='https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/central.html'>the US median wage</a> was $14,499 and in 2015 $29,930. It is about two-fold increase, so the ratio of average person’s situation to the extreme wealthy’s situation (which <i>is</i> measured meaningfully by wealth) has experienced 4-fold increase. This means that the economic power the wealthy has over the public has doubled twice.<p>

<p>Let’s put these numbers into perspective. If we take the average wealth of a person on <cite>Forbes 400</cite> and divide that by the median wage, we get a number that says how many years of avearage person’s work an average extremely rich person’s wealth is worth. Using the numbers I quoted, we get 50,000 years in 1991 and 200,000 years in 2015. This number is a meaningful measure of economic inequality, and it shows that the inequality is going up.</p>

<h2>1.2 Technology degenerates the labour market</h2>

<p>The mass power of workers, usually in the form of unions, is the force that pushes wages up. It hasn’t been able to keep up with the highest stacks of wealth, and so the inequality has risen. The reason is that modern business is only partially powered by labor. Technology, and in some cases land, takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>Technology lets a large business run with a small number of workers. For example Exxon Mobil, a huge oil and gas corporation, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil'>had</a> 73,500 employees and $218.6 billion revenue in 2016, which is about $3 million or a hundred median wages per employee. In a corporation powered 100% by workers (which is not possible in practise) the revenue per employee would be of the same order of magnitude as the typical wage.</p>

<p>The effect that technology has on the labor market is that there is less work to do than what people could do. Almost all work will be done by workers that work full weeks, because there is a very stubborn belief according to which a decent person works a lot. This means that some people will be left with no work at all. In other words, technology causes unemployment.</p>

<p>This undersupply of work heats up the competition about jobs along workers. The mass power of workers suffers, as they start to see each other as competitors instead of allies. This allows businesses to pay low salaries, as there is always someone who’s willing to accept to be abused rather than jobless.</p>

<p>Unemployment rates havent’t exploded, because last century’s machines have been clumsy. They have required much guidance from humans. Another reason is that machines have also been mostly mechanical devices that have required humans for building and repairing them.</p>

<p>These things are changing quickly. First, artificial intelligence (AI) is nowadays capable to accomplish many not-so-strictly defined tasks, and the need for human guidance is going down. Second, technology is more and more computer code, which doesn’t need to be manufactured in a factory or repaired. The physical machines needed for bringing code into life are being manufactured in highly automatized factories.</p>

<p>Today’s AI is not a mystical force waiting for the time to take control over the world. Rather, it’s a paradigm for optimizing general-purpose mathematical machines—usually so-called neural networks—for accomplishing tasks we cannot describe exactly, yet which we can measure numerically. It’s absolutely vital for the task to be numerically measurable, since optimization means looking for greater performance. Most of our jobs are pretty dull and are, or consist of parts that are, measurable with numbers. AI will eventually eat every job of that kind.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the human activity needed approaches zero in many fields. Take as an example our absolutely most vital resource, food. It’s somewhat straightforward to produce, and its production doesn’t have any steps that could not be automated in the near future. Farming and processing are already highly automatized—except if extremely low-cost slave-like labor is available—and transporting will soon be given to self-driving cars and drones. Even <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKCVol2iWcc'>high-end cooking can be left for machines</a>. In the near future—say before 2035—the whole food production chain from the seed to the plate requires no more than a few system managers to feed thousands of people.</p>

<h2>1.3 Poverty will become the new norm</h2>

<p>The practical impact that 21. century technology will have on the economy is enormous. For example, at some point autopilot machinery for a car will cost less than month’s salary of a driver. That will destroy driving as a profession. Many professions share the same near-future fate and unemployment will pass 50%.</p>

<p>When more than half the population are jobless, competition of jobs is obviously vicious. Union power is gone and people accept lower and lower salaries. Unemployment compensation cannot be paid to those who need it, since its funding comes from the employed, who’s income is shrinking fast.</p>

<p>The basic needs of a human being will not disappear. In a world of no salaries people will be divided in two: those who have wealth that brings income enough for covering the costs of living, and those who don’t. Obviously, the majority will fall into the latter category; most of us have exactly or virtually zero profitable wealth. These people will become absolutely poor, and need to successfully beg, steal or die.</p>

<p>Business is an uncertain sports, and sometimes a trader looses it all. He or she then joins the crowd of absolutely poor. On the other hand, it is completely impossible to climb up from poverty, since trading always requires at least some capital, and in a world of megacoporations and megarich any attempt to compete will be crushed by simple force. The percentage of people living in absolute poverty approaches 100%.</p>

<p>Absolute poverty, public sector rapistuu, etc</p>

<p>We are heading towards a situation in which one person owns everything.</p>

<!--<p>In the future more or less all wealth is created by existing wealth, and paid human work becomes a marginal phenomenon. Technology and business becomes indistinguishable from each other as robots take over trading, which <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading'>is already happening</a>. Indeed, stocks are an abstraction that hides the actual mechanisms of capital accumulation under a single bureaucratic piece of wealth that just generates more wealth for its owner.</p>-->

<!--<p>The result is an economy in which high wealth stacks grow highig
hhas most people are jobless, and those who have jobs are paid little. Of course there are some exceptions: skilled key employees of capital accumulation machines like corporations and investment funds will be paid well. This includes CEO’s and other chief executives, hedge fund managers, AI and big data experts and so on.</p>-->

<!--<p>In the future more or less all wealth is created by existing wealth, and paid human work becomes a marginal phenomenon. Technology and business becomes indistinguishable from each other as robots take over trading, which <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading'>is already happening</a>. Indeed, stocks are an abstraction that hides the actual mechanisms of capital accumulation under a single bureaucratic piece of wealth that just generates more wealth for its owner.</p>-->

<!--<p>So the wealth inequality is getting worse and worse and worse. At the same time the markets become less and less functional. Competitors form cartels and eventually merge as big monopolies who can set prices as high as they want. While poverty increases, so does the costs of living.</p>-->

<h2>1.4 Exponential evolution</h2>

<p>On average any large stack of wealth grows by a fixed percentage every year; the absolute rate by which the stack grows is proportional to its size. Such growth is said to be exponential, or exponentially fast. As the poor become poorer, some unfortunate traders drop into poverty, and high stacks of capital merge, also the wealth inequality worsens exponentially fast.</p>

<p>When a quantity grows exponentially, also its rate of change, and rate of change of its rate of change, and so on, grow exponentially. (This is a simple mathematical fact: the derivative of the exponent function e<sup><i>t</i></sup> is exactly the same exponent function e<sup><i>t</i></sup>.)</p>

<p>This means that exponential growth is first painfully slow. It may seem that nothing happens. Anyway, it’s speeding up all the time, and at some point the change becomes visible. It’s still speeding up, more quickly than before, and soon the growth has surprised all spectators.<p>

<p>A bacterial flora grows exponentially as long as there are enough resources available: the population doubles as the time of reproduction passes. When farmed on a petri dish, for a long time it seems that the dish is empty. Then, something emerges. Then, a little while and a significant portion of the dish is filled with colorful stuff. The rule of thumb is that when we see changes in an exponentially growing quantity, an explosion is behind the corner.</p>

<p>Mousetraps and ping-pong balls make <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjqIJW_Qr3c'>a nice demonstration</a> of exponential growth. Another one is folding paper: the thickness of a paper doubles at every fold. As I’ve tried it with a standard A4 paper, I can only do six folds. After those the paper is about half a centimeter thick, which makes the seventh fold impossible.</p>

<p>Theoretically, if I could continue folding, after 37 more folds the paper would be so thick that while its lower side rest on my palm, the upper is on a higher altitude than the orbit of Moon. This is no joke but a mathematical truth—2<sup>37</sup> &times; 0.5 cm = 687,195 kilometers, while the distance from here to Moon is something like 400,000 kilometers.</p>

<p>The point is that the economic power of the wealthiest individuals grow quicker than one would guess. An average <cite>Forbes 400</cite> fortune is worth 200,000 years of work. As we saw, that number had doubled twice in 24 years. Extrapolating the trend, in 2041 the number will be 800,000 years. In 2053 the combined economic power of <cite>Forbes 400</cite> will be 640 million years of work, which is enough for hiring the entire US population for two years.</p>

<p>This is probably an underestimate, since technology drives unemployment up and value of work down. Since technology evolves fast, the estimate is likely be much too soft.</p>

<p>In fact, in many cases technology evolves exponentially fast. Stone tools were invented millions of years ago, steam engine has been around a couple of hundred years. General purpose computer, or Turing machine, is few decades old. We also have more precise indications about the exponential evolution of technology:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moore’s Law means the trend of exponential growth of transistor number on a silicon chip. The number doubled every two years for at least 40 years.</li>
<li>If we take account all computing devices, the price of computing has dropped exponentially for <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/31409423572/'>120 years in a row</a>, halving every two years.</li>
<li><a href='http://hintjens.com/blog:29'>The cost of laser printing halved every two years from 1985 to 2010.</a></li>
<li>The sizes of neural networks, which are the modern approach to AI, <a href='http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html'>have halved every 2.4 years</a> for 30 years or so.</li>
</ul>

<p>Technology seems to evolve exponentially in a 




 Complete economic slavery is about to begin soon, maybe in 20 years.</p>


<p>Moore’s Law means the trend of exponential growth of transistor number on a silicon chip. The number doubled every two years for at least 50 years. If we take account all computing devices, the price of computing has dropped exponentially for 120 years in a row, halving every two or three?? years. <a href='http://hintjens.com/blog:29'>The cost of laser printing halved every two years from 1985 to 2010.</a>

<h3>USA</h3>

<p>There are about 300 million US citizens. The 400 richest US Americans together own <a href='http://time.com/4053748/forbes-400-richest-americans/'>about $2 trillion</a>, while the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States'>total US wealth</a> is about $100 trillion.

<p>According to Oxfam’s report <a href='https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/economy-1'><cite>An Economy For the 1%</a>, in 2010 there was 388 individuals who owned as much as the poorest half of the whole world population. According to another Oxfam’s report, <a href='https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/economy-99'><cite>An economy for the 99%</a> in 2017 there are eight people who own as much as the poorest half.</p>
