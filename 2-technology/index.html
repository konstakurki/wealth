<h1 id='2-technology'>2. Technology</h1>

<p><em>Updated on August 4, 2017</em></p>

<p>Technology, the force that eats jobs, is nothing but ways of arranging things in the world so that humans need to do less, yet results will be better. In short, technology is being smart.</p>

<p>If we, for example, need to move a box full of stuff a few kilometers to another village, we may just drag or carry the box—or we may put circle-like objects, called wheels, under the box, and then drag it. Then we don’t need to keep the box up in the air, nor we need much force for moving it. Wheel is simple, yet incredibly effective technology for moving things around.</p>

<p>What we call high-tech is fundamentally no different from simple technologies like wheel. There may be more moving parts, and the physical phenomena and mathematics exploited may be more exotic, yet it’s always about being smart. There is never magic at play; if there is a feeling of magic, it disappears at the moment you find out how the technology works.</p>

<h2>2.1 Revolutions</h2>

<p>What determines whether a technology is revolutionary or not? The answer is, whether it solves a real problem of human life or not. Here are some real revolutions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fire solved the problem of how to turn hard food soft. It enabled us to evolve smaller jawbone, freeing space for larger brains??.</li>
<li>Steam engine solved the problem of how to generate physical force without using our muscles. It enable us to build trains, motorized ships and later power plants.</li>
<li> Semiconductors and Turing-complete computer architectures solved the problem of how to build general-purpose information processing machines. It free us from doing well-defined thinking tasks by ourselves.</li>
<li>Internet solved the problem of how to instantaneously send any information between any two places. It allowed us to maintain friendships and work over an arbitrary distance. Modern mobile broadband is capable to stream HD video, which exceeds the human capacity to receive information. Once such Internet reaches every place on Earth, our communication problem is solved for good.</li>
</ul>

<p>Technological hype is a common phenomenon, since it advances sales of new technology. Most often the hype is a bubble and “revolutionary” just isn’t revolutionary. Unjustified hype can be exposed by asking the defining question: does it solve a real problem?</p>

<ul>
<li>Space tourism is not revolutionary, since space is an incredibly dull place.</li>
<li>Computer brain implants are not revolutionary, since smartphones have already plugged us into Internet 24/7.</li>
<li>Hoverboards? are not revolutionary, since we already have legs and bicycles.</li>
</ul>

<!--<h3>Virtual and augmented reality</h3>

<h3>Closed-source software and cloud services</h3>-->

<p>It’s important to recognize false hype, as it is a mind control method by which our decisions are steered towards irrational directions, and it overloads our brains so that we may become blind to technologies that really matter.</p>

<p>Currently there are two real revolutions going on. First, computers and Internet enabled us write code together, as a community. Code is text that makes machines do what we want them to do. When we write code together, we are building a single huge ocean of technology that will eventually solve all our information related problems in such a way that everyone has 100% access to the complete ocean, with no cost or restrictions.</p>

<p>Second, our computers are nowadays so powerful that we have a implementable answer to the question “How to make machines accomplish tasks we don’t have instructions for?”, provided that we know how to measure how well the task has been accomplished. The answer is <em>machine learning</em>. It’s the technology that all state-of-art AI systems use.</p>

<p>The revolutions of code and machine learning are final technological revolutions in the sense that they will free us from all labor. Only development and maintenance jobs will be left, and the fraction that they take off our time approaches 0%.</p>

<p>Also, a third real revolution is coming. It is the revolution of distributed computing.</p>

<h2>2.2 Revolution I: Code</h2>

<p>Technology is knowledge. As such it’s pure information, in principle. To actually use a technology, you need to physically change things in the world, and if we’re talking about traditional technology, doing so may be very expensive. You may need to solder electronic components on a circuit board, or glue pieces of wood together, or something like that.</p>

<p>In the world of code everything is different. All you need to do is to run the code on your computer. In many cases that takes only a fraction of a second and a negligible amount of electricity. Furthermore, once a piece of code has been written, it can be spread all over the world via Internet, again with negligible cost. So, if the authors of the code allow it to be distributed freely, as they do in the case of <em>free software</em> or <em>open source</em>, using code does not cost a thing.</p>

<p>In practise it works like this: if the code you want to use is mature enough, it probably is available in a software repository. If it is, you use the package manager of your system to fetch and install the corresponding package. If I, for example, want to install a program caller <code>cmatrix</code>, I just type <code>sudo apt install cmatrix</code> and hit enter. To run the program, I type <code>cmatrix</code> and hit enter. (How can it be so simple? See <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager'>Package manager</a> on Wikipedia for more information.) If the code is in a more experimental phase, you can most likely find it on a site like GitHub or GitLab.</p>

<p>Traditionally, testing has been the expensive part of developing a technology. To build a safe car, multiple prototypes must be built and then be destroyed in crash tests. Code can be tested with no costs, and therefore be developed without money. Only time, passion and a little bit of skill is needed.</p>

<p>History confirms that. In 1983 Richard Stallman announced the GNU Project, which aimed to develop a completely free operating system, and in a few years all pieces but the kernel had been written. Then in 1991 Linus Torvalds wrote a free kernel, which is now known as Linux. The combination, which goes by names GNU/Linux, GNU+Linux or just Linux, is a massive success: it is used largely on web servers, supercomputers use it almost exclusively, and Android phones are based on it (or the kernel?). Linux comes in numerous slightly different flavors, for example Debian and Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Community works so well in writing code, because there are so many people in the world. <a href='http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-19.5M-Stats'>By 2015</a> about 15 thousand people had contributed 19.5 million lines of code to the Linux kernel, which is quite a lot. Those contributors make about two millionth of the world population. In other words, a tiny, tiny fraction of us is enough to write massive amounts of state-of-art code.</p>

<p>When a community writes code, all the pieces become available to everyone, and anyone can build on anyone’s previous work. This truth manifests itself in software libraries, which consist of pieces of code that are intended for use as building blocks of larger programs. Library wraps those pieces in such a way that the user (the person who writes the large program using the library) only needs to learn an API (the interface via the library is accessed). Thanks to libraries, writing serious software is often just connecting existing pieces with relatively few lines of code and little effort.</p>

<p>Information technology shows the exponential nature of tech evolution clearly, as every step taken speeds up the next. In the 80’s co-writing software was sluggish, because interchanging pieces of code had to be done by mechanically transporting media like tape or discette. Internet changed this. Another significant milestone was in 2005, when Linus Torvalds decided to write a free version control system for developing the Linux kernel. He named the software Git. There is a free book, <a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2'><cite>Pro Git</cite></a>, that teaches Git in depth.</p>

<p>Git functions by saving snapshots, or “commits,” of a project as it evolves. The development can be branched (or forked) into several separate development lines of successive commits, which can then be merged back to one. This enables many developers to work simultaneously on one project irrespective of their schedules or geographic locations. Sites like GitHub and GitLab host Git repositories, making it incredibly easy to contribute to an open source project: you find the project at the site, fork it, make your changes, and then request the project maintainers to merge your contribution.</p>

<p>All these steps—GNU, Linux, package managers, libraries, Git—can be seen as points on an exponential curve which pushes the costs—measured in terms of money, time, effort and snapped nerves—of any computing task down to zero.</p>
